The Post Office

This small application I wrote some months ago for my company and we use it for submitting of a postal list to the nearby postal office. The advantage using this program in comparison with a manually filled post list, is the sender do not have to have the weight of all the various shipments, first time it is shipped it is weighed and the weight along with a descriptive text goes into a database.

Use of the system:
You have to fill out the various fields in the Set-Up-form. These fields are used on the Excel spreadsheet. You also have to make some entries to the Package-form in order to extract those for a postal list.
Now click the button marked: “New Postal List”, the fields ‘Post Number’, ‘Postal Date’ and ‘delivery Number’ will automatically be written.
We now assume you have some items in the “Package database”, double click the Grid cell marked “Weight a piece”, the package-grid will show. Select the package in question and click the ‘Exit’-button. The fields:

Post Number
Post Date
Line No.
Post Line No.
Weight a piece
Ref. text

Will now be written.  Select the postal category A, B or C and type an X in the appropriate field.
Now type the quantity in either the “Number Sorted” or the “Number Unsorted” field. The system will now calculate and show the sum weight this line. Continue with new lines until this shipment is done.

When everything is ok, click the “Print Post List”-button and the system will automatically fill out the Excel template and print it to the default Windows printer.

This source code is yours for the taking, you can alter and modify it as you wish.
Have a nice day
